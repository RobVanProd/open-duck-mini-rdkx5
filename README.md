# Open Duck Mini RDK-X5 Runtime And Sim-To-Real Diagnostics

Private working repository for the Open Duck Mini RDK-X5 board runtime, robot-specific calibration evidence, and non-invasive sim-to-real diagnostic tooling.

This repository exists because the live board runtime at `/home/sunrise/project/Open_Duck_Mini_Runtime-2_RDK_X5` is an RDK-X5 fork and is not a git repository. The goal is to preserve the exact board-side runtime and make diagnostics reproducible before changing training, gains, offsets, IMU remaps, friction, phase timing, or policy behavior.

The repository and its documentation are part of the robot's working state. Keep them current when the board runtime, config, evidence, analysis results, or next diagnostic gate changes.

## Current Next Step

The ground-up RDK-X5 runtime has cleared the supported, no-policy hardware
gates through Gate 4. Policy work remains offline and Gate 5 remains closed.

The completed T1 accelerometer-bias dose response proves that the robot's
upright `accel_x` mismatch is behaviorally first-order: `+1.6 m/s^2` reduced
the unmodified baseline's simulated forward velocity by `86.41%`. T2 is held
because the exact corrected-replay raw JSONL is unavailable. T4 is complete
and independently audited: all `32/32` baseline cells, cell contracts, raw
result hashes, aggregates, and gate rows reproduce exactly. The baseline
finishes all cells without a fall but fails `13` current gate rows. Under the
preregistered decision rule, a gate the baseline fails cannot remain a minimum
feasibility boundary unless it is relaxed to baseline evidence; it may instead
remain explicitly labeled as a stretch goal. T4 makes no automatic gate
change.

The read-only T5 protection-envelope audit has also changed the policy
decision boundary. Feetech documents duration-triggered over-current and
overload protection, not a one-tick rejection at stall torque/current. When
the frozen V121, V123, and V128 traces are reclassified using the documented
two-second rules, all three become complete `16/16` nominal passes. V177 also
becomes `16/16` as a post-handoff diagnostic. This meets the preregistered
reopen rule, but it does not select a policy or authorize training.

Current gate:

HOLD_GATE_5_PENDING_CORRECTED_GATE_ROBUSTNESS_REVALIDATION
```

Read these first:

outputs/analysis/WINNER_V177_NOMINAL_BEHAVIOR_RESULT_20260725.md
```

The next step is to preregister the corrected-gate robustness comparison of
the already-frozen surviving policies, using T4 to distinguish baseline
feasibility boundaries from stretch goals and T5 for the manufacturer-derived
servo-protection rules. No new optimizer run is earned while a frozen policy
may already satisfy that corrected contract.

## Current Board State

- Board: D-Robotics RDK-X5, hostname `ubuntu`
- Current SSH target: `sunrise@192.168.1.50`
- Runtime on board: `/home/sunrise/project/Open_Duck_Mini_Runtime-2_RDK_X5`
- Python env on board: `/home/sunrise/duck_env/bin/python`
- Policy: `/home/sunrise/BEST_WALK_ONNX_2.onnx`
- Policy SHA256: `3c606f9381a1710cc8fecdb7442787dcbfce3ee9bc02a6f1224774ab2b3a1067`
- `imu_upside_down`: `true`
- `start_paused`: `true`
- IMU calibration pickle: not found in the snapshot search paths

The exact live config snapshot is in `evidence/20260621T180046Z_rdkx5_config_snapshot.json`.

## Repository Layout

```text

instrumentation/         Additive diagnostic files to deploy into runtime/
tools/                   Workstation analysis and snapshot utilities

```

## Safety Rules

- Do not run walking tests until home pose, IMU tilt, foot contact, joint identity, and suspended replay checks pass.
- Do not run suspended replay unless `v2_rl_walk_mujoco.py` exposes opt-in telemetry support and the replay command writes JSONL telemetry.
- Do not tune gains, offsets, action scale, friction, phase timing, IMU remaps, or policy code during evidence collection.
- Any moving diagnostic must be run with the robot physically supported unless the test explicitly says grounded.
- Keep fingers clear and be ready to cut power.
- Moving diagnostics require an explicit safety flag in the command.

## Diagnostic Gate Order

Run this order. Stop immediately if a gate fails.

```text
1. snapshot_robot_config
2. home_pose_log_test
3. analyze home pose log
4. imu_tilt_test
5. analyze IMU tilt log
6. foot_contact_test
7. joint_identity_test
8. suspended_policy_replay, x = 0.0
9. suspended_policy_replay, x = 0.08 only if x = 0.0 looks sane
10. push test
11. grounded_policy_replay
12. actuator_sine_sweep
```

The first strict gate is upright acceleration:

```text
obs[3:6] should be roughly [small, small, +9.5]
```

Expected ONNX accel means:

```text
obs[3] accel_x ~= -0.037894
obs[4] accel_y ~= -0.079717
obs[5] accel_z ~=  9.490142
```

Suspended replay evidence must include both JSONL telemetry and terminal log
capture so servo CRC/read warnings and control-budget warnings are visible in
the gate summary before increasing command speed.

CRC/read retry warnings are not an automatic stop. The suspended replay gate
holds only when they correlate with control damage such as dt spikes, action
saturation or jumps, post-startup tracking spikes, write failures, visible
twitching, or a read-error burst. Otherwise the gate reports
`WARN_PROCEED_WITH_CAUTION` and the next low-risk suspended command can be
considered.

## Key Live Calibration Facts

The live `duck_config.json` offsets are recorded in `evidence/duck_config_20260621T180046Z.json` and `docs/joint_map_template.yaml`.

Notable offsets:

```text
left_knee  -1.4880 rad
right_knee  0.0798 rad
```

This asymmetry may be legitimate after mechanical repair, but it must be verified by home-pose telemetry and `joint_identity_test`. Do not change it without evidence.

## Board Runtime Differences

The board runtime is not identical to the local upstream reference:

- `raw_imu.py` uses an RDK-compatible `I2CCompat` layer.
- `feet_contacts.py` uses `Hobot.GPIO` on RDK-X5.
- `rustypot_position_hwi.py` retries servo bus operations.
- `joints_dir` is all `+1.0`; no software sign flip is intended.

See `docs/SIM2REAL_AUDIT.md` for the full map.

## Deployment

Read `docs/DEPLOY_INSTRUMENTATION.md` before copying instrumentation to the board. The instrumentation is designed to be additive and disabled by default, but board runtime files should still be backed up before any overwrite.

Check the runtime telemetry contract locally before deploying:

```bash
python3 tools/check_runtime_telemetry_contract.py
```

Dry-run first:

```bash
bash scripts/deploy_instrumentation_to_duck.sh --dry-run
```

Apply only after the plan is reviewed:

```bash
bash scripts/deploy_instrumentation_to_duck.sh --apply
```

## Analysis

Use the workstation tools for analysis. The board Python env has `onnxruntime` but not `onnx`, so ONNX normalization extraction should usually run off-board.

```bash
python3 tools/analyze_telemetry_obs.py path/to/home_pose_log_test.jsonl \
  --onnx-model policy/BEST_WALK_ONNX_2.onnx
```

## What Not To Do Yet

- Do not retrain.
- Do not tune offsets.
- Do not patch IMU axes or offsets.
- Do not change action scale.
- Do not change gains.
- Do not change phase timing.
- Do not debug friction/TPU/contact until sensor/action/joint truth tables pass.
