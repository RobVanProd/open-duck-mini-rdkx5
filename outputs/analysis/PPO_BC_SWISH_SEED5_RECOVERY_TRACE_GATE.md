# Candidate Seed Sweep

Offline multi-seed closed-loop candidate gate. This does not SSH, deploy,
train, or touch the robot.

## Distribution Summary

| policy | runs | falls | duration_complete | samples_mean | samples_min | samples_max | track_ratio_mean | vx_mean | body_pitch_p95_mean | base_height_min_mean |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|

## Interpretation

- Treat this as a stability distribution, not a deployability approval.
- A candidate still needs the standard full-duration x=0.0 and x=0.08
  gates reviewed before any robot-side validation.
- If fall samples vary widely across seeds, grade later recipes by
  distribution shift, not by a single lucky rollout.
